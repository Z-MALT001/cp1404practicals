# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

My completion time estimates was usually almost always dead on. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Stayed about the same, I was usually only ever off by 10 minutes give or take. But if I was off by 
a lot it was usually because I didn't realise how big the task was.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

I learnt that I'm good at estimating periods of time and how long it takes me to complete different
tasks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

I learnt like with anything that you write yourself, you usually can't spot your own errors
until someone points them out to you, or you come back to your work after improving your 
proficency with said skill.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

I didn't really get to do to many sadly. But from the couple I did get to do that it's important
to guide people towards the answer rather than just giving it to them. Well I already knew this but
let's say I learnt it here.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

https://github.com/ewabuczkowska/cp1404practicals/pull/2#issuecomment-2451069179

### Explanation

I believe this to be a good code review as I point out the issue and guide the code writer to 
think about the potential issues in their code and how to fix them.

### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/RAMIZ6969/cp1404practicals/pull/4#issuecomment-2480905793

### Explanation

Just fyi, this was the only other code review I got to do.
I consider this a good code review because even though it doesn't point out a mistake, it provides 
the recipient with positive reinforcement which can spur people to continue improving.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

Nothing, I liked the practical tasks, they were challenging enough that you could actually learn.
Having them every week also forces you to think about the subject, therefore resulting in you 
potentially learning more. Although it does get a little bothersome, especially when there's a lot
of other stuff coming due at the same time.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I actually did them all to a rather good standard (mostly), instead of just rushing through to 
get it done.
